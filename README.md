I could not figure out which Twitter API to use and couldn't get it to work, but the other three tasks are working properly.

For the OMDB 'movie-this' task, instead of typing the movie after the 'movie-this' command, I decided to do a prompt using inquirer because I thought it was a much easier way to capture the movie title instead of trying to concatenate a bunch of process.argv indexes into one string.
